# Smart Building Security, Access Control and IoT Monitoring System

> Embedded security system built on LPC2129 ARM7 microcontroller with multi-level authentication, automatic door control, event logging, and IoT cloud monitoring.

---

## Overview

This project implements a complete smart building security system for controlling and monitoring entry to a building. Only authorized users can enter through RFID card or keypad password authentication. Every access attempt is logged with timestamp and uploaded to the ThingSpeak IoT cloud.

The entire system runs on the **LPC2129 ARM7 microcontroller** programmed in bare-metal Embedded C using Keil µVision4.

## Features

- **RFID Authentication** — RC522 reads card UID via SPI, compares against stored UID in EEPROM
- **Keypad Password** — 4×4 matrix keypad for secondary password authentication
- **Two attempts** for both RFID and password before lockout
- **Automatic door control** — Servo motor opens and closes door after successful authentication
- **PIR motion detection** — detects human presence before starting authentication
- **Event logging** — every access attempt saved to AT24C08 EEPROM with RTC timestamp
- **IoT monitoring** — authentication results uploaded to ThingSpeak via ESP-01 WiFi
- **CAN communication** — security events broadcast to other nodes via MCP2551
- **LED + Buzzer indicators** — Green LED for success, Red LED for failure, buzzer for alerts
- **LCD display** — real-time status messages throughout authentication flow
- **UART debug log** — all events printed to PC terminal at 9600 baud
